			<h2 class="pavadinimas2">Interesting fact #3</h2>
			<p>Born in Bangkok, Viphurit “Phum” Siritip is the youngest son of his Thai parents. Phum discovered his passion for music

		<h2 class="pavadinimas1">About</h2>
		<p>
			Viphurit was born in Bangkok, Thailand. His father is an architect, while his mother is a graphic designer. The music-loving
			family migrated to Hamilton, New Zealand, when Phum was nine years old. He got his first instrument there; a drum which
			he desired since he was little. However, Viphurit was forced to stop playing drum and turned to guitar since the drum
			sound was said to be disturbing the neighbours. Viphurit moved back to Thailand when he was 18 to study at Mahidol University
			International College. In Thailand, Viphurit became known on from his original and cover songs on YouTube, and signed
			to indie label Rat Records. He released his debut album Manchild in 2017. His following two singles, "Long Gone" and "Lover
			Boy", earned him international recognition as their music videos spread online. He toured internationally in 2018, performing
			in Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Poland, Germany, England, France, Switzerland, Italy, the Netherlands, the United
			States, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Singapore.
