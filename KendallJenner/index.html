    <p> <B>TELEVISION CAREER:</B> In 2007, Kris Jenner pitched a reality TV show idea to Ryan Seacrest, resulting in the creation of "Keeping Up with the Kardashians" (KUWTK), debuting in 2007 on E! network. The show, featuring Jenner's family, became a massive success, leading to spin-offs like "Kourtney and Kim Take Miami" and "Kourtney & Khloé Take the Hamptons." After almost 15 years, KUWTK ended in 2021. In 2022, the family returned with a new show, "The Kardashians," on Hulu.

Jenner's success continued, walking for major brands and becoming an official Estée Lauder representative in 2014.
    <br>

    </div>

           <ul>
            <li>I think a natural look is prettier. I rarely wear makeup, but we always wear sunscreen on our faces.</li>
            <li>I'm a very loyal and very private person when it comes to my personal life. But I obviously do have Twitter and Instagram, and I will share some of the things I'm doing.</li>
            <li>I try not to be too invasive into my personal life. When I was younger, I used to tweet a lot, everything I was doing and feeling. I can't do that anymore, because it's just giving people too much room to judge.</li>
            <li>I think social media has taken over for our generation. It's a big part of our lives, and it's kind of sad.</li>
            <li>I love a red lip - red is one of my favorite colors, and I really don't wear many other lipstick colors than red.</li>
            <li>When I started getting in front of the camera a lot, I think my confidence started to come out.</li>
            <li>I've really learned to appreciate a moment. I take things in a lot. I'm kind of weird like that.</li>
            <li>You can get a million comments about how beautiful you look and how awesome you are, but the one comment that says they hate you and you're ugly is the one that sticks.</li>
            <li>My parents taught me that work ethic is one of the most important keys in life, and I believe it.</li>
           <li>I think mascara is a must. If I'm going to wear makeup somewhere, and I'm doing it, it's usually really simple - it's just mascara and maybe a tiny bit of eyeshadow, but that's it. <li>
           <li>I think it's important to be kind to yourself. You're not your own person, and you're not the only one in the world. You're not the only one who's been through the same things as you are.</li>
           <li>I'm big about washing my face before I go to bed, washing it when I wake up in the morning, getting good sleep and drinking a lot of water. Those are just easy things that you can do for your skin.</li>
          <li>I like to go outside at night by myself and look at the sky and just appreciate it. I'm not that big of a weirdo, but - occasionally.</li>
