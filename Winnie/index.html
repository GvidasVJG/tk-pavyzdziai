      <strong>Background</strong>
    </p>
    <p> Pooh Bear resides in the Hundred Acre Wood, an imaginative world inhabited by anthropomorphic stuffed toys and animals that Christopher Robin frequents. Pooh is stuffed with fluff, and there for impervious to pain. Due to his obesity, his seams rip open on occasion, but Pooh has become so accustomed to this that he can tie it back together in seconds. Pooh's tree house—which is under the name Sanders—is mostly filled with jars and jars of honey, which he harvests from beehives throughout the day.

     <strong>Development</strong>
    </p>
     
    <p>
      "Winnie-the-Pooh," as he was originally called, first appeared in a story written by A.A. Milne, who based the characters off his young owner Christopher Robin Milne and the boy's stuffed animals. The original toy bear was named after Winnie (short for "Winnipeg"), a bear that had been adopted as a cub by a Canadian soldier during World War I, who was a popular attraction at the London Zoo. The stories were popular in the Disney household, motivating Walt to start production on a series of featurettes starring the honey-obsessed bear and his collection of friends.

      <strong>Character</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Tigger is an ironic, mischievous, energetic tiger originally introduced in A.A. Milne’s book The House at Pooh Corner. Like other Pooh characters, Tigger is based one of Christopher Robin Milne’s favorite stuffed animals.
      Tigger is recognized as orange fur with black stripes, large eyes, a long chin, a springy tail, and his bouncy personality (Both literally and Figgeratively). His striped tail is long and can make a "Boing!" sound.

    <p>
      <strong>Character</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Rabbit is one of the animal inhabitants of the Hundred Acre Wood and one of the most important characters, appearing in almost all Winnie the Pooh stories.
    </p>

   
    <p>
      While loyal to the friends he knows, Rabbit shows a certain reluctance to welcome newcomers, as evidenced by his initial negative reaction to the arrival of Kanga and Roo in the first book, and to Tigger in the second book. Nonetheless, he warms up to all of them in time.
