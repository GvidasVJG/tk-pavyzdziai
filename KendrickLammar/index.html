      <h1>ABOUT</h1>
      <b><i>Kendrick Lamar Duckworth (born June 17, 1987) is an American rapper and singer-songwriter. Known for his
          cinematic storytelling, melodic cadences, and artistic reinventions, he is regarded as one of the most
          influential artists of his generation, earning him the nickname "King Kendrick". He was named the
          second-greatest rapper of all time by Billboard and Vibe in 2023.</i></b>
      <p>Kendrick Lamar grew up in the challenging environment of Compton, California. Surrounded by gang activity and
        socioeconomic struggles, Lamar was exposed to the harsh realities of his community from an early age. Despite
        the difficulties, he found refuge and inspiration in music. Lamar's passion for storytelling and expressing his thoughts led him
        to start writing poetry as a child, eventually transitioning into songwriting.</p>

        <h1>Inspiration</h1>
        <p>Tupac Shakur is Duckworth's biggest influence, having impacted both his professional and personal lives. One
          of his earliest childhood memories is watching him and Dr. Dre film the second music video for their single
          "California Love" with his father at the Compton Swap Meet. Duckworth has described himself as an "offspring"
          of Shakur's artistry and sociopolitical views. Although some publications regard him as the Shakur of his
          generation, he strives to maintain his individuality.</p>
