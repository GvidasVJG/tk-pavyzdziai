		<h1>Career</h1>
    <h3>2015–2017</h3>
		<p>
      Beginnings, record deal, and early projects
      Higgins began to develop as an artist in his first year of high school. His first track, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88BiaTnToZU&ab_channel=MamanTVMamanTV"
      target="_blank" class="linkas">Forever</a>", was released on SoundCloud in 2015 under the name JuicetheKidd. He changed his name from JuicetheKidd, a name inspired by his affection for rapper Tupac Shakur's role in the film Juice, to Juice Wrld because he and his associates believed the change would benefit his career. In an interview with the Atlanta radio station WHTA, Higgins revealed that the latter part of his stage name initially had no meaning but that he came to think it "represents taking over the world".</p>

			while the flight was en route, that they suspected there were guns and drugs on the plane. Law enforcement officials later
			revealed they found three handguns and 32 kg of marijuana on the aircraft. They also said several members of Higgins'
			management team aboard the flight told them that Higgins had taken "several unknown pills", including allegedly swallowing
			multiple Percocet pills to hide them while police were on board the plane searching the luggage. Higgins then began convulsing
			and seizing, after which two doses of the emergency medication Narcan were administered as an opioid overdose was suspected.
