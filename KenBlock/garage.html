               <h2>1994 FORD ESCORT RS COSWORTH WRC COSSIE V2</h2>
            </div>
            <p>After losing his previous 1991 Ford Escort Cosworth Group A rallycar to a fire while racing in the summer of 2018, Ken Block knew exactly what he had to do for 2019: build an all-new Cossie! And for his “Cossie V2,” he’s taken all of the things both he and the fans loved about the original Ford Escort Cosworth and has enhanced them in a big way. Block and digital creative Ash Thorp set out to design a modern interpretation of what a Ford Escort RS Cosworth rallycar would look like if the Escort came out today and the current Ford team that designs the World Rally Championship cars were to design it. The result? The Cossie V2. Arguably the most wild-looking Escort RS “Cossie" ever built.</p>

            <p>The award winning Hoonitruck was created for <a href="./gymkhana.html"><b>Gymkhana</b></a> TEN, partially out of Block’s general love for trucks, and also as a a tribute to his late father who had the exact same base truck back in the day. While on display with Toyo Tires at the 2019 Tokyo Auto Salon, the Ford F-150 Hoonitruck won the TAS best “dressed” truck/SUV award!</p>

            </div>
            <p>Ken Block’s 1965 Ford Mustang Hoonicorn RTR V2 builds upon where the original Hoonicorn left off. Taking that car that starred in <a href="./gymkhana.html"><b>Gymkhana</b></a> SEVEN, Block and his team have modified the 410 cubic inch Roush Yates Ford V8 heart of the Hoonicorn to now feature a custom twin turbo setup from Garrett that feeds the boost through a custom Switzer Dynamics intake manifold. The end result? 1,400 horsepower that's fed through the Sadev all wheel-drive system. Designed from the start to take a car that was already crazy and make it absolutely insane, Block has done so. Now the Hoonicorn V2 gets ready for its next video project.</p>

            <p>Ken Block's newest daily driver is his 2016 Ford Focus RS. Equipped with fifteen52 Turbomacs and Toyo R1R tires, it's the ideal around-town ride for Block when he's home in Park City, Utah, and is in the mood to drive something a bit more nimble than his Ford F-150 Raptor.</p>

            <p>Ken Block teamed up with SVC Offroad once again to create this very jumpable Ford F-150 Raptor based on a 2017 model truck that SVC used for parts development. Loaded with upgrades and finished with a reflective Hoonigan livery, this bad-ass truck is a properly sorted, and more desert fun-oriented Ford Raptor build ready for the desert playgrounds of southern Utah.</p>

            <p>Fully frame-off restored by NSB Performance in Edgewater, Florida, Block’s wife’s Bronco (aka: #wifeybronco) isn’t your normal 1974 model. Built to be the ultimate summer, around-town, and on-trail Park City truck, it features a slew of upgrades including a Ford Performance supplied 5.0l Coyote crate V8 and transmission, many replacement panels supplied by National Parts Depot, and fifteen52 wheels with Toyo Tires.</p>
